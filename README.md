Battleship Browser Game
The is an adapted version of the classic board game battleship. This is a two player game. Each player is represented by 10x10 grid that contains 5 hidden, randomly placed ships of varying length. Ships can be placed horizontally or vertically. Gameplay consists of the players taking turns attempting to 'hit' their opponents ships by targetting and clicking a square on the opponents board. 

A ship is sunk by 'hitting' all squares that it occupys.

A player wins by successfully sinking all of their opponents ships.
